## Clean Architecture with DDD Principles
- **Clean Architecture** with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles represents the core architectural approach of this application.
- Clean Architecture emphasizes a clear separation of concerns and a layered structure, consisting of the `API`, `Application`, `Contracts`, `Domain`, and `Infrastructure` layers.
- **DDD principles** are applied within the `Domain` layer, where domain entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, domain services, and **Domain Events** are defined.
- **Domain Events** provide a mechanism for implementing domain-driven design patterns such as event sourcing and ensuring that domain events are raised and handled appropriately within the application.

- DDD encourages modeling the problem domain accurately, creating a shared understanding between domain experts and developers, and building software that closely aligns with the real-world problem it's meant to solve.

1. **API**:
   - The `API` folder houses the entry point for your application, with an emphasis on thin controllers.
   - Thin controllers help adhere to the principles of Clean Architecture, which emphasize separation of concerns and decoupling.
   - Controllers in this layer primarily serve as a bridge between client requests and the application's core functionality.
   - Thanks to the clean separation of concerns, transitioning to other types of APIs like GraphQL or RPC becomes relatively straightforward.
   - To switch to a different API technology, you would mainly need to adapt the API layer to handle the specific input and output formats required by the new API while keeping the core application logic (located in the `Application`, `Contracts`, `Domain`, and `Infrastructure` layers) mostly untouched.
   - This separation makes it easier to evolve and scale your application by introducing new APIs or changing existing ones without causing extensive changes to the underlying business logic.

1. **Application**:
   - The `Application` folder houses the application's business logic and use cases.
   - It typically includes services, application-specific domain logic, and use case implementations.
   - This layer represents the application's core functionality and is responsible for orchestrating interactions between the various parts of the system while adhering to the business rules.

2. **Contracts**:
   - The `Contracts` folder usually contains interfaces or abstractions that define contracts for various parts of the application.
   - These contracts could include interfaces for repositories, services, and other components that need to be implemented in different layers of the application.
   - Contracts facilitate decoupling and dependency inversion, allowing for easier testing and interchangeable implementations.

3. **Domain**:
   - The `Domain` folder represents the heart of your application, containing the domain model and business entities.
   - Here, you define the core concepts and objects that are essential to the application's problem domain.
   - Domain objects often encapsulate business rules and behaviors, making it a pure representation of the application's domain logic.

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - The `Infrastructure` folder houses infrastructure-related code and implementation details.
   - This includes database access, external service integrations, logging, and other technical concerns.
   - Infrastructure components should be abstracted behind interfaces defined in the `Contracts` folder, ensuring that the core application is not tightly coupled to specific technologies or frameworks.

- By combining Clean Architecture with DDD principles, this application achieves a modular, testable, and maintainable structure while ensuring that the core business logic is well-structured and aligned with the problem domain.

## Structured Logging with Serilog
- Structured Logging with Serilog is an integral part of this architecture's approach to logging. Structured logging focuses on associating key-value pairs with log events, allowing for a more organized and context-rich log output. Serilog is a popular logging library in the .NET ecosystem, known for its flexibility and extensibility.

- **Benefits of Structured Logging:**
  - Improved Log Analysis: Structured logs make it easier to query and analyze log data. You can filter, search, and aggregate log events based on specific properties or fields, which is particularly useful when troubleshooting issues.
  - Contextual Information: Each log entry can include contextual information related to the specific operation or request, providing a more comprehensive understanding of what was happening at the time of the log event.
  - Flexibility: Serilog allows you to send log events to various sinks, including the console, files, and external services like Seq, which enables centralized log management and analysis.
- **Logging Sinks:**
  - **Console:** Logging to the console is useful during development and debugging, providing immediate feedback to developers.
  - **File:** Writing logs to files allows for persistent storage of log events, which can be crucial for auditing and long-term analysis.
  - **Seq:** Seq is a log server that can receive, store, and provide advanced querying and visualization capabilities for log data. Integrating with Seq offers a scalable solution for log management and analysis in production environments.

Structured logging with Serilog contributes to a better understanding of application behavior and aids in diagnosing issues. It's a valuable addition to the architecture, supporting both development and production scenarios.

## Patterns
### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- CQRS is a design pattern that separates the responsibility for handling commands (write operations) from queries (read operations).
- In the `Application` layer, CQRS is implemented using commands and queries, often with the help of libraries like MediatR for command and query handling.
- Commands represent actions that change the state of the application, while queries retrieve data without modifying it.
- This separation of concerns simplifies the design and scaling of the application, as command and query paths can be optimized differently.
- CQS: Methods can either change state or return a value - not both.
- CQRS: Like CQS, but not as strict regarding the return value, with a clear boundary between Commands and Queries.
- Mediator Pattern: Promotes loose coupling between objects by having them interact via a mediator rather than referencing each other.
- MediatR: An in-memory implementation of the Mediator pattern, where MediatR requests & MediatR handlers are wired up during the DI setup.
- Splitting Logic By Feature: Organizing each use case in a separate file.

### Mediator Pattern
- The **Mediator Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that helps reduce the coupling between objects by enabling them to communicate through a mediator rather than directly referencing each other. In the context of software architecture, a mediator acts as a central hub for managing communications between various components or objects. This pattern promotes better maintainability and extensibility by isolating how objects interact and making it easier to add or modify interactions without affecting the objects themselves.
- In this architecture, the Mediator Pattern is used to enhance the organization and maintainability of the application. It helps decouple the components involved in handling commands and queries, promoting a clean and modular structure. When a command is issued or a query is made, it's sent to the mediator, which then routes it to the appropriate handler. This pattern is essential for implementing CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) because it enforces a clear separation between commands that modify application state and queries that retrieve data without making changes.
- The application utilizes the Mediator pattern to promote loose coupling between objects. It enables objects to interact via a mediator (MediatR) rather than directly referencing each other, enhancing maintainability and testability.

### MediatR
- **MediatR** is an open-source library for .NET that provides an in-memory implementation of the Mediator Pattern. It simplifies the implementation of the Mediator Pattern by offering a framework for handling requests and routing them to their corresponding handlers. In this architecture, MediatR is used to wire up requests (commands and queries) with their respective handlers during the dependency injection setup.
- MediatR supports the separation of concerns between the sender of a request and its handler, making it easier to add new commands and queries to the application without tightly coupling them to specific components. By employing MediatR, the application can scale by introducing new use cases and handlers with minimal impact on the existing codebase. This makes it a valuable tool for maintaining a flexible and extensible architecture.

### Validation With MediatR And FluentValidation
- **FluentValidation** is a popular .NET library that focuses on providing a clean and expressive way to define and perform validation for data models, including the validation of commands and queries. It allows you to specify validation rules declaratively, improving the readability of validation logic and making it easier to maintain and extend.
- In this architecture, FluentValidation is integrated seamlessly with MediatR to ensure that incoming commands and queries are validated against the defined rules before being processed. This ensures that the data passed to the application adheres to business rules and requirements. When a request is received by MediatR, it automatically runs the associated validation rules using FluentValidation. If a request doesn't pass validation, it can be intercepted and handled accordingly, preventing invalid data from affecting the application's state.
- This combination of MediatR and FluentValidation streamlines the request handling process and enforces data integrity within the application. It's particularly valuable in maintaining a robust and reliable system by preventing potentially erroneous or malicious data from entering the application's core logic. Additionally, it enhances code maintainability by keeping validation rules separate from the main application logic.

### Repository Pattern
- The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that provides an abstraction layer for data access operations.
- It is typically used in the `Infrastructure` layer to separate data access code from the rest of the application.
- Repositories define a set of methods for retrieving and storing domain objects, making it easier to work with the underlying data store.
- This pattern promotes separation of concerns and testability in data access operations.
- The Repository Pattern can be especially advantageous when applied to the Command side of a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) implementation. It provides a structured mechanism for managing data access and modifications, contributing to the organization and maintainability of your application.

### Custom Problem Details Handling
- Custom Problem Details Handling is an essential part of this architecture's error management and response customization. It involves the use of the Problem Details error model specification, which is an industry-standard format for conveying error details in HTTP responses. The architecture further enhances this mechanism by implementing custom logic for handling and presenting problem details.
- **Problem Details Error Model:** This is a standardized format for representing errors in HTTP responses. It includes details like the error type, title, status code, and additional error-specific data. By following this standard, the architecture ensures that error responses are consistent and machine-readable.
- **Problem Method in the ControllerBase:** The architecture makes use of the `Problem` method available in the base controller. This method simplifies the creation of problem details responses, allowing developers to generate clear and consistent error responses for various scenarios. It provides a convenient way to return problem details when exceptions or validation errors occur.
- **Custom ProblemDetailsFactory:** To further customize the handling of problem details responses, a custom `ProblemDetailsFactory` has been implemented. This component allows developers to fine-tune the presentation of error information to clients. It can be used to create problem details responses that include additional context-specific details, making error responses more informative and user-friendly.
- Overall, Custom Problem Details Handling helps ensure that the application's error responses are structured, consistent, and user-friendly. By providing detailed information about errors, it enhances the developer and user experience, making it easier to diagnose and address issues that may occur during API interactions.

### Flow Control using ErrorOr
- Flow Control using ErrorOr is a mechanism to enhance error handling and result reporting within the architecture. It leverages the ErrorOr library, which is a discriminated union representing either a successful result or an error. This approach provides a clear and structured way to manage both expected and unexpected outcomes in the application's logic.
- **ErrorOr Library (ErrorOr<Success, Error>):** The ErrorOr type is a discriminated union with two possible states: Success or Error. It is used to encapsulate the result of operations. When an operation is successful, the Success state contains the result data, and when there's an error, the Error state captures error details.
- **Flow Control Enhancement:** The ErrorOr type is applied to various parts of the application logic to streamline error handling and reporting. It ensures that errors are explicitly handled and not overlooked, while successful results can be easily extracted and used as needed.
- By using Flow Control with ErrorOr, the architecture promotes a more robust and reliable way to manage the flow of logic. Developers can clearly distinguish between successful outcomes and errors, making it easier to respond to different scenarios effectively.

### API Versioning
- API versioning is a crucial aspect of this architecture that ensures the longevity, stability, and adaptability of the application's APIs. Here's a more detailed explanation of how it works:
- **Why API Versioning:** As an application evolves over time, there's often a need to make changes to the APIs that it exposes. These changes can include adding new features, modifying existing endpoints, or deprecating endpoints that are no longer needed. Without proper versioning, changes to the API could break existing clients that rely on its structure and behavior. API versioning addresses this challenge by allowing different versions of the API to coexist.
- URI Versioning: In this approach, the version is specified as part of the URI. For example, an API might have endpoints like `/v1/users` and `/v2/users`, where `v1` and `v2` indicate the API versions. This makes it explicit and easy to identify the version being used. However, it can lead to longer and less clean URIs.
- **Backward Compatibility:** API versioning ensures backward compatibility, meaning that existing clients that are built on a specific version of the API will continue to work as expected, even when newer versions are introduced. This is crucial for preventing disruptions to client applications and maintaining a positive user experience.
- **Smooth Transitions:** When introducing breaking changes or new features, API versioning allows for smooth transitions. Newer clients can opt to use the latest version with its enhancements, while existing clients continue to interact with the older version without any issues. This approach is particularly valuable when dealing with a diverse set of clients, which may include mobile apps, web applications, or third-party integrations.
- **API Documentation:** Effective API versioning should be accompanied by comprehensive API documentation. It's important to document each version, detailing the changes, features, and any deprecations. This enables client developers to understand how to use the different versions and plan for any necessary updates.
- **Graceful Deprecation:** When an API version reaches the end of its lifecycle, it can be deprecated, and developers can be encouraged to migrate to a newer version. Graceful deprecation involves providing ample notice and assistance to clients making the transition.
- In summary, API versioning is a fundamental practice that ensures the longevity and flexibility of APIs. It allows the architecture to evolve while minimizing the impact on existing clients. Effective API versioning, combined with clear documentation and developer communication, helps maintain a positive developer and user experience while enabling the adoption of new features and improvements.

### Outbox Pattern
- The **Outbox Pattern** is implemented to enhance the reliability and consistency of handling domain events coming from the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) components of the architecture. It addresses the challenge of ensuring that domain events are reliably dispatched even in cases of system failures or disruptions. Here's how it works:
- **Domain Events from DDD:** In the Domain layer, domain events are raised to signal specific changes or occurrences within the application. These events can include things like order placements, user registrations, or any other significant actions.
- **Outbox Implementation:** The Outbox Pattern provides a way to capture and store these domain events in a durable and reliable manner, typically in a persistent store (e.g., a database). This prevents events from being lost in cases where the event dispatching process is interrupted due to system failures, network issues, or other transient problems.
- **Event Dispatching:** After storing events in the outbox, a background process or service is responsible for periodically dispatching these events to their intended recipients. This ensures that domain events are eventually delivered, even if there are temporary issues preventing immediate dispatch.
- By implementing the Outbox Pattern, the architecture ensures that no domain events are lost, providing consistency and reliability in event-driven architectures. It's especially valuable when maintaining data integrity and ensuring that event-driven actions are processed correctly.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Authentication and authorization are fundamental aspects of securing an application, and in this architecture, they are implemented using **ASP.NET Identity:**
- **Authentication:** Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users accessing the application. ASP.NET Identity provides robust features for handling user authentication.
- **Authorization:** Authorization is the process of determining what actions and resources users are allowed to access. Role-based access control (RBAC) is often employed to manage authorization in ASP.NET Identity. Users are assigned roles, and these roles define what they can and cannot do within the application. This includes access to specific features, data, or functionality.
- **User Management:** ASP.NET Identity simplifies user account management, offering features for user registration, login, password recovery, and profile management. It provides a secure way to handle sensitive user data and ensure that user accounts are protected.
- **Security:** Security is a paramount concern in any application. ASP.NET Identity is designed with security best practices in mind. It includes features to protect against common security threats, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and more. It also assists in securing user passwords through hashing and salting techniques.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** In modern web applications, token-based authentication is prevalent. ASP.NET Identity provides the infrastructure to generate and manage tokens that are used for authentication and authorization. 

## Background Jobs and Fail-Safety
- Background jobs and fail-safety mechanisms are essential for maintaining the reliability and robustness of the application:
- **Background Jobs:** Background jobs are tasks that are executed asynchronously, often scheduled to run at specific intervals or triggered by events. The application utilizes the Quartz library to implement background job processing. Background jobs can be used for various purposes, such as sending emails, processing large data sets, or executing maintenance tasks without blocking the main application thread. This approach helps improve the responsiveness and performance of the application by offloading time-consuming operations.
- **Fail-Safety with Polly:** Fail-safety is crucial for ensuring that the application can recover from unexpected errors or disruptions. Polly is employed as a resilience and transient-fault handling library. Polly provides a set of policies that define how the application should react to different types of failures. For example, it can specify retry policies, circuit breakers, and fallback mechanisms. This ensures that even when external services or dependencies encounter issues, the application can gracefully handle these situations without crashing or becoming unresponsive.
- **System Reliability:** Together, background jobs and fail-safety mechanisms contribute to the overall reliability of the system. By processing tasks asynchronously and handling errors with resilience policies, the application is better prepared to withstand unexpected challenges. This is particularly important for applications that rely on external services or data sources, as it prevents a single failure from cascading and affecting the entire system.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** From a user perspective, these mechanisms result in a smoother and more reliable experience. Users are less likely to encounter application downtime or errors, and background jobs ensure that tasks are completed in a timely manner. This contributes to higher user satisfaction and trust in the application.

## Test Section
- The **Test Section** of the architecture is dedicated to ensuring the quality, reliability, and correctness of the application's codebase. It includes various types of tests, each serving a specific purpose:
- **Architecture Tests:** These tests focus on validating the overall structure and adherence to architectural principles. They ensure that the application's layers and components are correctly organized and that dependencies are appropriately managed. Architecture tests help maintain a well-structured and organized codebase.
- **Unit Tests:** Unit tests are designed to validate the functionality of individual units or components within the application. These units can include services, domain entities, application logic, and other discrete parts of the system. Unit tests are essential for verifying that each component behaves as expected and for catching regressions during development.
- **Unit Test CQRS Handlers:** Specific unit tests are created for CQRS handlers. These tests focus on verifying that commands and queries are handled correctly. For example, they confirm that the application responds appropriately to different types of commands and queries, maintaining data integrity and adhering to business rules. Unit testing CQRS handlers is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the application's core logic.
- The Test Section plays a vital role in maintaining code quality, catching bugs early in the development process, and ensuring that architectural and functional requirements are met. It also contributes to the overall reliability of the application by providing a safety net against regressions and errors.
- By including these testing practices, the architecture promotes a robust and maintainable codebase that can adapt to changing requirements with confidence.
